# Assignment 2 - Assessing Data Management

## Software Development – Overview

Software Development is my core skillset, or more specifically web application development. I was a political science major in college but was able to move into web programming because, basically, I showed up the day they opened the Internet (kidding, sort of). I have been developing for the web off and on for almost 30 years and have evolved into a competent program and application designer. Fortunately, along the way I’ve worked with “the full stack” – server to database to code, so I’ve enjoyed a range of technical experiences. I’m not a superstar at any level of the stack, but proficient at all.

Truthfully, I’m probably nearing the end of my career in development. I’m getting older, not particularly interested in pair programming with GitHub Copilot, and in general losing my steam. But I’m not necessarily nearing the end of my career, so the challenge is how to grow beyond software development.

## What I know

****Object-Oriented Design.**** It seems like people have been shoveling dirt on OOP for years, but it never seems to go away. And with good reason. OOP is still the best paradigm for complex systems with interacting pieces. I’ve been designing web applications with OOP for most of my career and I’m not sure I’m willing at this point to change to anything else (old dog, new tricks).

****C#.**** I began my coding career in 1997 with, of all things, Cold Fusion, back when it was a markup language Allaire. But that didn’t last long, and I quickly moved to classic ASP, and from there to C# and .NET as soon as it was released. As a result, I’ve been coding with C# off and on for more than twenty years. Admittedly, virtually all of my C# experience has been related to web development, so I never delved into the complexities of threading of xxx. But the I’m well-versed in the essentials of the language; and as my coding career heads to its twilight phase, I plan on riding C# into the sunset.

****JavaScript/React.**** As JavaScript has taken on increased importance in web development over the past decade I’ve tried to keep pace, as best as possible within the parameters of my organization’s app portfolio. This has mostly meant React. I’ve coded several UIs in React (often with dotnet backends or APIs) – it is a powerful tool and a joy to write. I would not say that I am a “JavaScript ninja,” but certainly my JavaScript skills have grown. That being said, React is expanding so rapidly, adding compilation and server-side elements, I’m doubtful that I can continue with it, without giving up something else.

****Waterfall Methodology.**** I have a lot of experience with greenfield projects that are developed the old-fashioned way – gathering requirements, designing, building, testing, pushing to production. Agile is all the rage today, and it has its place, but, call me old-fashioned, I still think Waterfall has a place when starting large projects from scratch.

## What I wish I knew

****Agile.**** My comments about Waterfall not withstanding, Agile is in fact all the rage, and I have never really worked in an Agile shop. At my current organization, we have something similar to daily stand-ups, but strictly speaking they are not structured around sprints. This is a disadvantage of working in smaller shops, we just don’t have the level of project management to make Agile work. It would be a disadvantage for me if when job searching I had to admit to potential employers that I’ve never really worked in an Agile environment. Agile has become the de facto standard for software projects.

****CSS.**** The sophistication around cascading style sheets (and styling in general) these days is truly remarkable, and a skilled front-end designer can make a web page do virtually anything. For a programmer, however, CSS can be a frustrating headache. Especially if as a coder you are working with pages designed in really in compiled CSS like SASS or intricate frameworks like Foundation. Inline styling is not necessarily best practice, but sometimes it’s the only way to get that image to right align! For my day-to-day activities, better proficiency in CSS would be a great help.

****Test Drive Development/Continuous Deployment.**** Another downside of working in small shops is that you may not gain familiarity with the kind of advanced processes that you might find in bigger organizations, like TDD and continuous deployment. In fact, I’ve never worked at a company that was really committed to test-driven development, or organized testing at all. Our development cycle is usually compressed to the point where testing is done by business analysts, and deployment is done “by hand.” If I had to move to a shop that did TDD, it would be a steep learning curve for me.

****Python.**** My eggs are kind of all in the C# basket (along with JavaScript, as noted above), and it would probably be beneficial to branch out at least a bit. Java would be a natural extension to working in C#, but the reality is that Java and C# are usually one or the other. Python, however, could be complementary, especially in the way it’s used with data analytics.

## Integration

Software development is probably the category into which all other categories are being integrated. Web development leans heavily on networking and security, and data is both its lifeblood and its yield. As a software developer, then, I’m trying to strengthen myself in other categories in order to optimize my applications.
